        // from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_de_Mallorca
        description:`Mallorca is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, which are part of Spain and located in the Mediterranean. The capital of the island, Palma, is also the capital of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. There are two small islands off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28 million passengers in 2017, with use increasing every year since 2012. The name derives from Classical Latin insula maior, “larger island”. Later, in Medieval Latin, this became Maiorca, “the larger one”, in comparison to Menorca, “the smaller one”. This was then hypercorrected to Mallorca by central Catalan scribes, which later came to be accepted as the standard spelling.`,

        description:  `Crete is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands. It bounds the southern border of the Aegean Sea, with the Sea of Crete to the north and the Libyan Sea to the south. Its capital and largest city is Heraklion, located on the north shore of the island. Humans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago. Crete was the centre of Europe’s first advanced civilization, the Minoans, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the Mycenaean civilization from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the Byzantine Empire, Andalusian Arabs, the Venetian Republic, and the Ottoman Empire. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the Cretan State. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.`,
